--------

The current live datasets for [MIBiG] live in the `data` directory.
Datasets that have been retired because of duplications, or annotation and/or
sequence data quality issues can be found in the `retired` directory.
To download the sequences described by the JSON files, there is a script in the
`scripts` directory. The `genbanks` directory contains a handful of sequence
files that are not available from NCBI's GenBank/RefSeq databases.
